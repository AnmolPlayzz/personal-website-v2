## Installation and Usage

To view this website locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the repository is located.
3. Install the `serve` package using npm by running the following command:

    This will install the `serve` package globally on your machine.

4. Once the installation is complete, run the following command:
